# Let's Encrypt App for Django

`django-letsencrypt` will allow you to add, remove, and update any
[ACME challenge](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) objects you may
need through your Django admin interface. Simply add the `ACME challenge`
and `response` for your app to serve up the necessary information for
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) validation.

This project strives to make installation, configuration, and usage a snap!
From high levels of code coverage, multiple compatible python versions, multiple
versions of Django supported, even multiple databases too!

And of course all wrapped up and published to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-letsencrypt/) for standard installation!

# Example Project

If you would like a demo of how to use this application simply clone this project's
`git` repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/urda/django-letsencrypt),
take a moment to read the `README.md` file within the
[`example_project`](https://github.com/urda/django-letsencrypt/tree/master/example_project)
directory, and follow the directions. That will spin up a small sample django
application already configured for you to try out.

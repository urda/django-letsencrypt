    - Python `3.6`
    - Python `3.7`
    - Python `3.8`
  - `pytz>=2020.1` is now required.
  - Travis Updates:
    - For the time being, we will continue to use `travis`.
    - Updated to support target versions as detailed for both Django and Python.

    - Updated `.python-version` file to latest values.
